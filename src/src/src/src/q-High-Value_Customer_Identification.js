      <h5>VaultCommerce: Customer Lifetime Value Analysis</h5>
      <p>
        VaultCommerce segments customers into Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Premium tiers 
        based on purchase history. Marketing needs to know which segment has the highest 
        average order frequency (orders per customer) to design targeted retention campaigns.
      </p>
      
      <h6>Database Schema</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><code>customers</code>: customer_id, name, email, segment, signup_date</li>
        <li><code>orders</code>: order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount, status</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>SQL Requirements</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Filter orders to status = 'completed' only</li>
        <li>Join customers and orders tables</li>
        <li>Calculate orders per customer by segment: COUNT(orders) / COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id)</li>
        <li>Group by segment and order by average frequency descending</li>
        <li>Return the segment name with highest order frequency</li>
