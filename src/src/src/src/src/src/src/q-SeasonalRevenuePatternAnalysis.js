      <h5>RetailPulse: Quarterly Revenue Seasonality</h5>
      <p>
        RetailPulse operates 50 stores across 3 regions. They want to understand which 
        quarter consistently shows the highest year-over-year growth rate to optimize 
        inventory planning for the next fiscal year.
      </p>
      
      <h6>Dataset Schema</h6>
      <ul>
        <li><code>store_id</code>: Store identifier (S001-S050)</li>
        <li><code>transaction_date</code>: Date of transaction (2022-2024)</li>
        <li><code>revenue_usd</code>: Daily revenue per store</li>
        <li><code>region</code>: North, South, East</li>
      </ul>
      <h6>Python Task</h6>
      <ol>
        <li>Load CSV and extract quarter from transaction_date using pd.to_datetime()</li>
        <li>Group by year and quarter, sum revenue across all stores</li>
        <li>Calculate YoY growth rate: (revenue_current - revenue_previous) / revenue_previous</li>
        <li>Average the growth rates across years for each quarter</li>
        <li>Identify which quarter (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) has highest average YoY growth</li>
